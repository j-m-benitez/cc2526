# Intro to container orchestrators

Although you can certainly manage research workflows that use multiple containers manually, there are a number of container orchestration tools that you may find useful when managing workflows that use multiple containers. Also running containers in production is tough: what happens **if the containers die**? How do you **scale** across several machines? **Container orchestration** solves these problems. 

The general idea behind container orchestrators is that you have “managers” who receive an expected state. This state might be “I want to run two instances of my web app and expose port 80.” The managers then look at all of the machines in the cluster and delegate work to “worker” nodes. The managers watch for changes (such as a container quitting) and then work to make actual state reflect the expected state.

In this lesson we briefly describe a few options and point to useful resources on using these tools to allow you to explore them yourself.

**Docker (Podman) Compose**

Docker (Podman) Compose provides a way of constructing a unified workflow (or service) made up of multiple individual Docker containers. In addition to the individual Dockerfiles for each container, you provide a higher-level configuration file which describes the different containers and how they link together along with shared storage definitions between the containers. Once this high-level configuration has been defined, you can use single commands to start and stop the orchestrated set of containers.

**Kubernetes**

Kubernetes is an open source framework that provides similar functionality to Docker Compose. Its particular strengths are that it is platform independent and can be used with many different container technologies and that it is widely available on cloud platforms so once you have implemented your workflow in Kubernetes it can be deployed in different locations as required. It has become the de facto standard for container orchestration.

**Singularity Compose**

Singularity compose is intended to run a small number of container instances on your host. It is not a complicated orchestration tool like Kubernetes, but rather a controlled way to represent and manage a set of container instances, or services.

**Docker Swarm**

Docker Swarm provides a way to scale out to multiple copies of similar containers. This potentially allows you to parallelise and scale out your research workflow so that you can run multiple copies and increase throughput. This would allow you, for example, to take advantage of multiple cores on a local system or run your workflow in the cloud to access more resources. Docker Swarm uses the concept of a manager container and worker containers to implement this distribution.

Let's go into more detail for some of the most popular container orchestration tools. 

# Docker Compose

Docker (Pomdan) Compose is a Docker (Podman) tool used to define and run multi-container applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services and create all the app’s services from that configuration.

Think of Docker Compose as an automated multi-container workflow. Compose is an excellent tool for development, testing, CI workflows, and staging environments. According to the Docker documentation, the most popular features of Docker Compose are:

- Multiple isolated environments on a single host
- Preserve volume data when containers are created
- Only recreate containers that have changed
- Variables and moving a composition between environments
- Orchestrate multiple containers that work together

First, we need to understand how Compose files work. It’s actually simpler than it seems. In short, Docker Compose files work by applying mutiple commands that are declared within a single ```docker-compose.yml``` configuration file.

The basic structure of a Docker Compose YAML file looks like this:

```
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
     - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
     - .:/code:Z
  redis:
    image: redis
```

Now, let’s look at a real-world example of a Docker Compose file and break it down step-by-step to understand all of this better. Note that all the clauses and keywords in this example are commonly used keywords and industry standard.


With just these, you can start a development workflow. There are some more advanced keywords that you can use in production, but for now, let’s just get started with the necessary clauses.

```
services:
  web:
    # Path to dockerfile.
    # '.' represents the current directory in which
    # docker-compose.yml is present.
    build: .

    # Mapping of container port to host
    
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    # Mount volume 
    volumes:
      - "/usercode/:/code"

    # Link database container to app container 
    # for reachability.
    links:
      - "database:backenddb"
    
  database:

    # image to fetch from docker hub
    image: mysql/mysql-server:5.7

    # Environment variables for startup script
    # container will use these variables
    # to start the container with these defined variables. 
    environment:
      - "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root"
      - "MYSQL_USER=testuser"
      - "MYSQL_PASSWORD=admin123"
      - "MYSQL_DATABASE=backend"
    # Mount init.sql file to automatically run 
    # and create tables for us.
    # everything in docker-entrypoint-initdb.d folder
    # is executed as soon as container is up and running.
    volumes:
      - "/usercode/db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql"
    
```


- `services`: This section defines all the different containers we will create. In our example, we have two services, web and database.
- `web`: This is the name of our Flask app service. Docker Compose will create containers with the name we provide.
- `build`: This specifies the location of our Dockerfile, and . represents the directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located.
- `ports`: This is used to map the container’s ports to the host machine.
- `volumes`: This is just like the -v option for mounting disks in Docker. In this example, we attach our code files directory to the containers’ `./code` directory. This way, we won’t have to rebuild the images if changes are made.
- `links`: This will link one service to another. For the bridge network, we must specify which container should be accessible to which container using links.
- `image`: If we don’t have a Dockerfile and want to run a service using a pre-built image, we specify the image location using the image clause. Compose will fork a container from that image.
- `environment`: The clause allows us to set up an environment variable in the container. This is the same as the -e argument in Docker when running a container.

To deploy the services (this will likely give an error as we don't have specified the necessary Dockerfiles yet):

```
docker compose up -d
```

To un-deploy the services:

```
docker compose down
```

When using podman, the corresponding commands to deploy the services re:
```
podman-compose up -d
```

And to un-deploy them:
```
podman-compose down
```





Docker Compose commands

Now that we know how to create a docker-compose file, let’s go over the most common Docker Compose commands that we can use with our files. Keep in mind that we will only be discussing the most frequently-used commands.

`docker compose`: Every Compose command starts with this command. You can also use docker compose <command> --help to provide additional information about arguments and implementation details.


```
$ docker compose --help
Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.
```


`docker compose build`: This command builds images in the docker-compose.yml file. The job of the build command is to get the images ready to create containers, so if a service is using the prebuilt image, it will skip this service.

```
$ docker compose build
database uses an image, skipping
Building web
Step 1/11 : FROM python:3.9-rc-buster
 ---> 2e0edf7d3a8a
Step 2/11 : RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker.io
```

`docker compose images`: This command will list the images you’ve built using the current docker-compose file.

```
$ docker compose images
          Container                  Repository        Tag       Image Id       Size  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7001788f31a9_docker_database_1   mysql/mysql-server   5.7      2a6c84ecfcb2   333.9 MB
docker_database_1                mysql/mysql-server   5.7      2a6c84ecfcb2   333.9 MB
docker_web_1                     <none>               <none>   d986d824dae4   953 MB
```

`docker compose stop`: This command stops the running containers of specified services.

```
$ docker compose stop
Stopping docker_web_1      ... done
Stopping docker_database_1 ... done
```

`docker compose run`: This is similar to the docker run command. It will create containers from images built for the services mentioned in the compose file.

```
$ docker compose run web
Starting 7001788f31a9_docker_database_1 ... done
 * Serving Flask app "app.py" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 116-917-688
```

`docker compose up`: This command does the work of the docker compose build and docker compose run commands. It builds the images if they are not located locally and starts the containers. If images are already built, it will fork the container directly.

```
$ docker compose up
Creating docker_database_1 ... done
Creating docker_web_1      ... done
Attaching to docker_database_1, docker_web_1
```

`docker compose ps`: This command list all the containers in the current docker-compose file. They can then either be running or stopped.

```
$ docker compose ps
      Name                 Command             State               Ports         
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker_database_1   /entrypoint.sh mysqld   Up (healthy)   3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   
docker_web_1        flask run               Up             0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp
 
$ docker compose ps
      Name                 Command          State    Ports
----------------------------------------------------------
docker_database_1   /entrypoint.sh mysqld   Exit 0        
docker_web_1        flask run               Exit 0    
```

`docker compose down`: This command is similar to the docker system prune command. However, in Compose, it stops all the services and cleans up the containers, networks, and images.

```
$ docker compose down
Removing docker_web_1      ... done
Removing docker_database_1 ... done

```

# Setup

On the server, you need to run ```dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install``` for the rootless docker install to work. To use podman compose, you need to run the following:

```
systemctl --user start podman.socket
```

# Docker Compose Use Case #1: Web server with Redis + Flask

First, we are going to deploy a Web server with Flask and a Redis database: 
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io)

## Step 1: Setup

Create a directory for the project:

```
mkdir composetest
cd composetest
```

Create a file called app.py in your project directory and paste this in:
```
import time

import redis
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)
cache = redis.Redis(host='redis', port=6379)

def get_hit_count():
    retries = 5
    while True:
        try:
            return cache.incr('hits')
        except redis.exceptions.ConnectionError as exc:
            if retries == 0:
                raise exc
            retries -= 1
            time.sleep(0.5)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    count = get_hit_count()
    return 'Hello World! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)
```

In this example, redis is the hostname of the redis container on the application’s network. We use the port 6379 that is the default port for Redis. This port is internal to the docker compose network and therewith can be used without fear that other people on the server will use the same port.

**Handling transient errors**. Note the way the ```get_hit_count``` function is written. This basic retry loop lets us attempt our request multiple times if the redis service is not available. This is useful at startup while the application comes online, but also makes our application more resilient if the Redis service needs to be restarted anytime during the app’s lifetime. In a cluster, this also helps handling momentary connection drops between nodes.

Create another file called requirements.txt in your project directory and paste this in:

```
flask
redis
```

## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

In this step, you write a Dockerfile that builds a Docker image. The image contains all the dependencies the Python application requires, including Python itself.

In your project directory, create a file named Dockerfile and paste the following:

```
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM python:3.7-alpine
WORKDIR /code
ENV FLASK_APP=app.py
ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0
RUN apk add --no-cache gcc musl-dev linux-headers
COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 5000
COPY . .
CMD ["flask", "run"]
```

This tells Docker to:

- Build an image starting with the Python 3.7 image.
- Set the working directory to /code.
- Set environment variables used by the flask command.
- Install gcc and other dependencies
- Copy requirements.txt and install the Python dependencies.
- Add metadata to the image to describe that the container is listening on port 5000
- Copy the current directory . in the project to the workdir . in the image.
- Set the default command for the container to flask run.

For more information on how to write Dockerfiles, see the Docker user guide and the Dockerfile reference.


## Step 3: Define services in a Compose file

Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in your project directory and paste the following:

```
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "25144:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

This Compose file defines two services: web and redis.

*Web service*

The web service uses an image that’s built from the Dockerfile in the current directory. It uses the default port for the Flask web server, 5000, internally in the docker compose network. It then binds the container and the host machine to the exposed port, 25144. **On the server, you need to change this port (25144) to a port that you have been assigned.** 

*Redis service*

The redis service uses a public Redis image pulled from the Docker Hub registry.

## Step 4: Build and run your app with Compose

From your project directory, start up your application by running docker compose up.

 ```
 docker compose up
 ```

Compose pulls a Redis image, builds an image for your code, and starts the services you defined. In this case, the code is statically copied into the image at build time.

Enter http://localhost:25144/ in a browser to see the application running.

If you’re using Docker natively on Linux, Docker Desktop for Mac, or Docker Desktop for Windows, then the web app should now be listening on port 25144 on your Docker daemon host. Point your web browser to http://localhost:25144 to find the Hello World message. If this doesn’t resolve, you can also try http://127.0.0.1:25144.

You should see a message in your browser saying:

```Hello World! I have been seen 1 times. ```

Refresh the page.

The number should increment.

```Hello World! I have been seen 2 times. ```

Switch to another terminal window, and type ```docker images``` to list local images.

Listing images at this point should include ```redis``` and ```composetest-web```.

````
docker image ls
````

You can inspect images with ```docker inspect <tag or id>```, check the logs with ```docker logs <tag or id>``` or even open a shell interactive session in both containers and check that they are listening to other IPs and bind to each other: 
```
$ docker exec -it <id for the flask container> sh
/code # netstat -an
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5000            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.11:40677        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      
tcp        0      0 192.168.32.3:46608      192.168.32.2:6379       ESTABLISHED 
udp        0      0 127.0.0.11:56331        0.0.0.0:*                           
Active UNIX domain sockets (servers and established)
Proto RefCnt Flags       Type       State         I-Node Path

$ docker exec -it <id for the redis container> sh
/data # netstat -an
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6379            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.11:45659        0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      
tcp        0      0 192.168.32.2:6379       192.168.32.3:46608      ESTABLISHED 
tcp        0      0 :::6379                 :::*                    LISTEN      
udp        0      0 127.0.0.11:34763        0.0.0.0:*                           
Active UNIX domain sockets (servers and established)
Proto RefCnt Flags       Type       State         I-Node Path

```

Stop the application by hitting CTRL+C in the original terminal where you started the app and then remove the containers by running ```docker compose down```. 

## Step 5: Edit the Compose file to add a bind mount

Edit docker-compose.yml in your project directory to add a bind mount for the web service:

```
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "25144:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code:Z
    environment:
      FLASK_DEBUG: True
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
```

The new ```volumes``` key mounts the project directory (current directory) on the host to ``/code`` inside the container, allowing you to modify the code on the fly, without having to rebuild the image. The ```environment``` key sets the ```FLASK_DEBUG``` environment variable, which tells flask to run in debug/development mode and reload the code on change. **This mode should only be used in development**.

## Step 6: Re-build and run the app with Compose

From your project directory, type docker compose up to build the app with the updated Compose file, and run it.

``docker compose up`` 

Check the Hello World message in a web browser again, and refresh to see the count increment.

Shared folders, volumes, and bind mounts

If your project is outside of the Users directory (cd ~), then you need to share the drive or location of the Dockerfile and volume you are using. If you get runtime errors indicating an application file is not found, a volume mount is denied, or a service cannot start, try enabling file or drive sharing. Volume mounting requires shared drives for projects that live outside of C:\Users (Windows) or /Users (Mac), and is required for any project on Docker Desktop for Windows that uses Linux containers. For more information, see File sharing on Docker for Mac, and the general examples on how to Manage data in containers.


## Step 7: Update the application

Because the application code is now mounted into the container using a volume, you can make changes to its code and see the changes instantly, without having to rebuild the image.

Change the greeting in app.py and save it. For example, change the Hello World! message to Hello from Docker!:

```return 'Hello from Docker! I have been seen {} times.\n'.format(count)```

Refresh the app in your browser. The greeting should be updated, and the counter should still be incrementing.

## Step 8: Experiment with some other commands

If you want to run your services in the background, you can pass the -d flag (for “detached” mode) to ```docker compose up``` and use ```docker compose ps``` to see what is currently running:

```
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

The ```docker compose run``` command allows you to run one-off commands for your services. For example, to see what environment variables are available to the web service:

```
docker compose run web env
```

See ```docker compose --help``` to see other available commands. You can also install command completion for the bash and zsh shell, which also shows you available commands.

If you started Compose with ```docker compose up -d```, stop your services once you’ve finished with them:

```docker compose stop```

You can bring everything down, removing the containers entirely, with the down command. Pass --volumes to also remove the data volume used by the Redis container:

```docker compose down --volumes```


# Docker compose Use Case #2: Monitoring system with Prometheus + NodeExporter

We are going to deploy a Basic monitoring version that allows to serve [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) + [NodeExporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/).

**Again, on the server, you need to change the port used here (25145, 25146, 25147) to ports that you have been assigned.**

Create a project/folder:

```
mkdir prometheus
cd prometheus
```

## NodeExporter 

First, we are going to deploy a NodeExporter Service. NodeExporter exposes a wide variety of hardware- and kernel- related metrics of usage of our system. 

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file

```
services:
  node-exporter:
    container_name: node1-exporter
    image: prom/node-exporter
    ports:
      - 25145:9100
```

Then, run:

```
docker compose up -d
```

And open in your browser http://localhost:25145 to check that the service is running. 

Once the Node Exporter is running, you can verify that metrics are being exported by going to [http://localhost:25145/metrics](http://localhost:25145/metrics) or by cURLing the ```/metrics``` endpoint:

```
curl http://localhost:25145/metrics
```
You should see output like this:
```
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the GC invocation durations.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 3.8996e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 4.5926e-05
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.5"} 5.846e-05
# etc.
```

Success! The Node Exporter is now exposing metrics that Prometheus can scrape, including a wide variety of system metrics further down in the output (prefixed with node_). To view those metrics (along with help and type information):
```
curl http://localhost:25145/metrics | grep "node_"
```

Then type:

```
docker compose down
```

## Prometheus

Second, to set up a Prometheus service, you need to create the following configuration .yml files in the same folder (```prometheus```). 

Create a file `prometheus.yml` and include the following:

```
global:
  scrape_interval: 30s
  scrape_timeout: 10s

rule_files:
  - alert.yml

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: services
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets:
          - 'prometheus:25146'
          - 'idonotexists:564'

```

Then create a `alert.yml` file

```
groups:
  - name: DemoAlerts
    rules:
      - alert: InstanceDown 
        expr: up{job="services"} < 1 
        for: 5m
```

Finally, add to the ```docker-compose.yml``` the following code for ```prometheus``` at the services level (```prometheus``` service should be at the same level than ```node-exporter``` since they are both ```services``` and the last ```volumnes``` should be at the root level):

```
  prometheus:
    container_name: node-prom
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.30.3
    ports:
      - 25146:9090
    volumes:
      - .:/etc/prometheus:Z
      - prometheus-data:/prometheus:Z
    command: --web.enable-lifecycle  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

volumes:
  prometheus-data:

```


This is how the final ```docker-compose.yml``` file looks like: 
```
services:

  node-exporter:
    container_name: node1-exporter
    image: prom/node-exporter
    ports:
      - 25145:9100      

  prometheus:
    container_name: node-prom
    image: prom/prometheus:v2.30.3
    ports:
      - 25146:9090
    volumes:
      - .:/etc/prometheus:Z
      - prometheus-data:/prometheus:Z
    command: --web.enable-lifecycle  --config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

volumes:
  prometheus-data:
```


Then type the following:

```
docker compose up -d
```

And open in your browser 2 tabs:
- http://localhost:25146 For Prometheus server
- http://localhost:25145 For Node Exporter

Check if all the services are running.


## Grafana

Now we are going to drop this service to add [Grafana](https://grafana.com) as a Prometheus stats visualizer. 
```
docker compose down
```

Add to the ```docker-compose.yml``` the following code for ```grafana``` at the services level:

```
  grafana:
    container_name: node-grafana
    image: grafana/grafana-oss
    ports:
      - 25147:3000
```

Then, run again:

```
docker compose up -d
```

And open in your browser 3 tabs:
- http://localhost:25146 For Prometheus server
- http://localhost:25145 For Node Exporter
- http://localhost:25147 For Grafana

Check if all the services are running.

### Using Grafana 

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability that lets you visualize and explore the state of your systems. You can find Grafana Tutorials [here](https://grafana.com/tutorials/). This tutorial will just cover the first steps to log into Grafana and create a query to plot some of the metrics forwared from Prometheus. 

Browse to http://localhost:25147 and log in to Grafana (username: admin, password: admin). The first time you log in, you’re asked to change your password (you can skip this). Once into Grafana, the first thing you see is the Home dashboard, which helps you get started. To the far left you can see the sidebar, a set of quick access icons for navigating Grafana.

To be able to visualize the metrics from Prometheus, you first need to add it as a data source in Grafana. In the sidebar, hover your cursor over the Configuration (gear) icon, and then click Data sources. Click Add data source. In the list of data sources, click Prometheus.

In the URL box, enter ```http://prometheus:25146```. Click Save & test. If this doesn't work, try with localhost or the name of the server.

Prometheus is now available as a data source in Grafana. Let's now add a query for a metric. In the sidebar, click the Explore (compass) icon, and click on Metrics. You can see the metrics that are available. You can now click directly on Explore to go into the Query editor. There, click the ```Code``` tag to directly input the PromQL query. In the ```Enter a PromQL query``` field, enter ```scrape_duration_seconds``` and then press Shift + Enter. A graph appears.

In the top right corner, click the dropdown arrow on the Run Query button, and then select 5s. Grafana runs your query and updates the graph every 5 seconds.

You just made your first PromQL query! PromQL is a powerful query language that lets you select and aggregate time series data stored in Prometheus.


# Singularity Compose

Singularity was conceived as a more secure option to run encapsulated environments. Unlike Docker, Singularity containers allows users to interact with processes in the foreground (e.g. running a script and exiting) and were not appropriate to run background services. This was a task for **container instances** (Singularity argot). A container instance equates to running a container in a detached or daemon mode. Instances allow for running persistent services in the background and then interaction with theses services from the host and other containers. To orchestrate and customize several of these Singularity instances, Singularity Compose came up (https://www.theoj.org/joss-papers/joss.01578/10.21105.joss.01578.pdf).

Singularity compose is intended to run a small number of container instances on your host. It is not a complicated orchestration tool like Kubernetes, but rather a controlled way to represent and manage a set of container instances, or services.

## Installation (not needed on the server)


Dependencies

Singularity Compose must use a version of Singularity 3.2.1 or greater. It's recommended to use the latest (3.8.0 release at the time of this writing) otherwise there was a bug with some versions of 3.2.1. Singularity 2.x absolutely will not work. Python 3 is also required, as Python 2 is at end of life.

Install singularity-compose using ```pip3```:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install singularity-compose

```

The obtained binaries for singularity-compose might be placed in a folder which is not in the ```$PATH```, and you might get a warning message from the installation for this:
```
  WARNING: The script singularity-compose is installed in './home/vagrant/.local/bin/singularity-compose' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
```

Either if you get the warning message or not, it is convenient to locate the binaries in your system and check that they are on ```$PATH``` or include them if not already in. 
```
$ find . -name singularity-compose -print
/home/vagrant/.local/bin/singularity-compose
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
$export PATH=$PATH:/home/vagrant/.local/bin
```
add the ```export``` command to your ```~/.profile``` file to make this change in the ```$PATH``` persistent in the bash shell.  


## Getting Started

For a singularity-compose project, it's expected to have a ```singularity-compose.yml``` in the present working directory. You can look at a simple example here:

```
version: "1.0"
instances:
  app:
    build:
      context: ./app
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
      - ./app:/code
      - ./static:/var/www/static
      - ./images:/var/www/images
    ports:
      - 80:80
```

If you are familiar with Docker Compose the file should look very familiar. A key difference is that instead of **"services"** we have **"instances."** And you guessed correctly - each section there corresponds to a Singularity instance that will be created. In this guide, we will walk through each of the sections in detail.

### Instance folders

Generally, each section in the yaml file corresponds with a container instance to be run, and each container instance is matched to a folder in the present working directory. For example, if I give instruction to build an nginx instance from an nginx/Singularity.nginx file, I should have the following in my singularity-compose:

```
  nginx:
    build:
      context: ./nginx
      recipe: Singularity.nginx
```

The above says that I want to build a container and corresponding instance named nginx, and use the recipe Singularity.nginx in the context folder ./nginx in the present working directory. This gives me the following directory structure:
```
singularity-compose-example
├── nginx
...
│   ├── Singularity.nginx
│   └── uwsgi_params.par
└── singularity-compose.yml
```
Notice how I also have other dependency files for the nginx container in that folder. While the context for starting containers with Singularity compose is the directory location of the singularity-compose.yml, the build context for this container is inside the nginx folder. We will talk about the build command soon. First, as another option, you can just define a container to pull, and it will be pulled to the same folder that is created if it doesn't exist.
```
  nginx:
    image: docker://nginx
```

This will pull a container nginx.sif into an nginx context folder:
```
├── nginx                    (- created if it doesn't exist
│   └── nginx.sif            (- named according to the instance
└── singularity-compose.yml
```
It's less likely that you will be able to pull a container that is ready to go, as typically you will want to customize the startscript for the instance. Now that we understand the basic organization, let's bring up some instances.

### When do I need sudo?

Singularity compose uses Singularity on the backend, so anything that would require sudo (root) permissions for Singularity is also required for Singularity compose. This includes most networking commands (e.g., asking to allocate ports) and builds from recipe files. However, if you are using Singularity v3.3 or higher, you can take advantage of fakeroot to try and get around this. The snippet below shows how to add fakeroot as an option under a build section:

```
    build:
      context: ./nginx
      recipe: Singularity.nginx
      options:
       - fakeroot
```

**However, for many containers this is not enough and you will still need to be root, for example to run the example from below. So, on our server most of the following examples will not work properly, and you should run them on a machine where you have root access.** 

## Quick Start

For this quick start, we are going to use the singularity-compose-simple examples. First, clone the repository:

```$ git clone https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-compose-examples.git```

cd into one of the examples, for example ```v2.0/jupyterlab```, and you'll see a singularity-compose.yml like we talked about.
```
$ cd v2.0/jupyterlab
$ ls
etc.hosts  README.md    second                   work
jupyter    resolv.conf  singularity-compose.yml
```

Let's take a look at the singularity-compose.yml

```
version: "2.0"
instances:
  jupyter:
    image: docker://umids/jupyterlab
    volumes:
       - ./work:/usr/local/share/jupyter/lab/settings/
    ports:
      - 8888:8888
    run:
      background: true
  second:
    build:
      context: ./second
    run: []
    depends_on:
      - jupyter
```

What we don't see in the folder currently is a container. We need to build that from the Singularity recipe. Let's do that.

```
$ singularity-compose build
```

Will generate a *.sif in the folder:

```
$ ls second/

second.sif  Singularity
```

And now we can bring up our instance!

```$ singularity-compose up```

Verify it's running:

```
$ singularity-compose ps
INSTANCES  NAME         PID     IP              IMAGE
1       jupyter1	772359	10.22.0.2	jupyter.sif
2        second1	773067	10.22.0.3	second.sif
```

And then look at logs, shell inside, or execute a command.

```
$ singularity-compose logs jupyter1
$ singularity-compose logs jupyter1 --tail 30
$ singularity-compose shell jupyter1
$ singularity-compose exec jupyter1 uname -a
```

When you open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8888 you should see the jupyter interface.


Finally, the volumes that we specified in the ```singularity-compose.yml``` tell us exactly where the application needs permissions to write. The folder ```/usr/local/share/jupyter/lab/settings/``` is bound to the container at ```/work```

This is likely a prime different between Singularity and Docker compose - Docker doesn't need binds for write, but rather to reduce isolation. When you develop an application, a lot of your debug will come down to figuring out where the services need to access (to write logs and similar files), which you might not have been aware of when using Docker.

### Networking 

When you bring the container up, you'll see generation of an etc.hosts file, and if you guessed it, this is indeed bound to /etc/hosts in the container. 

Let's take a look:
```
10.22.0.5	second1
10.22.0.4	jupyter1
127.0.0.1	localhost


# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

This file will give each container that you create (in our case, two) a name on its local network. Singularity by default creates a bridge for instance containers, which you can conceptually think of as a router. This means that, if I were to reference the hostname "second1" in a second container, it would resolve to 10.22.0.5. Singularity compose does this by generating these addresses before creating the instances, and then assigning them to it. If you would like to see the full commands that are generated, run the up with --debug.



# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services. Originally developed at Google and open-sourced in 2014, Kubernetes has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Its main capabilities are listed [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/#why-you-need-kubernetes-and-what-can-it-do). 

There is an EdX course on Kubernetes running right now. Check it out here: (https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2022/home)


## Kubernetes Architecture

At a very high level, Kubernetes is a cluster of compute systems categorized by their distinct roles:

- One or more control plane nodes
- One or more worker nodes

![Kubernetes cluster arquitecture](https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2022+type@asset+block@TrainingImage.png)

### Control Plane
The control plane node provides a running environment for the control plane agents responsible for managing the state of a Kubernetes cluster, and it is the brain behind all operations inside the cluster. It is important to keep the control plane running at all costs. Losing the control plane may introduce downtime, causing service disruption to clients, with possible loss of business. To ensure the control plane's fault tolerance, control plane node replicas can be added to the cluster, configured in High-Availability (HA) mode.

- To persist the Kubernetes cluster's state, all cluster configuration data is saved to a distributed key-value store which only holds cluster state related data, no client workload generated data. This key-value store is implemented with etcd (open-source). New data is written to the data store only by appending to it, data is never replaced in the data store. Obsolete data is compacted (or shredded) periodically to minimize the size of the data store. Out of all the control plane components, only the API Server is able to communicate with the etcd data store.

- All the administrative tasks are coordinated by the kube-apiserver, a central control plane component running on the control plane node. The API Server intercepts RESTful calls from users, administrators, developers, operators and external agents, then validates and processes them. During processing the API Server reads the Kubernetes cluster's current state from the key-value store, and after a call's execution, the resulting state of the Kubernetes cluster is saved in the key-value store for persistence. The API Server is the only control plane component to talk to the key-value store, both to read from and to save Kubernetes cluster state information - acting as a middle interface for any other control plane agent inquiring about the cluster's state.

- The role of the kube-scheduler is to assign new workload objects, such as pods encapsulating containers, to nodes - typically worker nodes. The scheduler obtains from the key-value store, via the API Server, resource usage data for each worker node in the cluster. The scheduler also receives from the API Server the new workload object's requirements which are part of its configuration data. Once all the cluster data is available, the scheduling algorithm filters the nodes with predicates to isolate the possible node candidates which then are scored with priorities in order to select the one node that satisfies all the requirements for hosting the new workload. The outcome of the decision process is communicated back to the API Server, which then delegates the workload deployment with other control plane agents.

- The controller managers are components of the control plane node running controllers or operator processes to regulate the state of the Kubernetes cluster. Controllers are watch-loop processes continuously running and comparing the cluster's desired state (provided by objects' configuration data) with its current state (obtained from the key-value store via the API Server). In case of a mismatch, corrective action is taken in the cluster until its current state matches the desired state.

### Worker nodes

A worker node provides a running environment for client applications. These applications are microservices running as application containers. In Kubernetes the application containers are encapsulated in **Pods**, controlled by the cluster control plane agents running on the control plane node. Pods are scheduled on worker nodes, where they find required compute, memory and storage resources to run, and networking to talk to each other and the outside world. A Pod is the smallest scheduling work unit in Kubernetes. It is a logical collection of one or more containers scheduled together, and the collection can be started, stopped, or rescheduled as a single unit of work. 
![](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/def37bf56d010897b7db29a7e292d90c/asset-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2022+type@asset+block/Single-_and_Multi-Container_Pods.png)

Although Kubernetes is described as a "container orchestration engine", it lacks the capability to directly handle and run containers. In order to manage a container's lifecycle, Kubernetes requires a container runtime on the node where a Pod and its containers are to be scheduled. Runtimes are required on all nodes of a Kubernetes cluster, both control plane and worker. Docker Engine can be used as container runtime. 

## How to deploy your local kubernets instance (with minikube)

Minikube is one of the easiest, most flexible and popular methods to run an all-in-one or a multi-node local Kubernetes cluster directly on our local workstations. It installs and runs on any native OS such as Linux, macOS, or Windows. However, in order to fully take advantage of all the features Minikube has to offer, a Type-2 Hypervisor or a Container Runtime (for example, Docker Engine) should be installed on the local workstation, to run in conjunction with Minikube.

For Minikube installation and getting started with this tool, we are going to follow the official [Get Started with Minikube tutorial](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) with more steps and info from the [LinuxFoundationX LFS158x EdX Course on Introduction to Kubernetes](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+1T2022/)

### Installation (should not be needed on the server)

Choose your OS and Arquitecture and Install Minikube: [(https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/#what-youll-need)

In particular, on a server where you don't have root access, if the software is not installed and you need to install it locally for you, you can follow these steps:

make a local folder for binaries if it doesn't exist already, and add it to the path:

```
mkdir ~/.local/bin 

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Download minikube and install to the directory:

```
curl -LO https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/latest/download/minikube-linux-amd64

install minikube-linux-amd64 ~/.local/bin/minikube && rm minikube-linux-amd64
```

Download kubectl and install to the directory:

```
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"

install kubectl ~/.local/bin/kubectl && rm kubectl
```

### Basic commands
Start your cluster. In theory, you can start it with ```minikube start```.

On the server, to start it with docker, you need:

```
minikube start --container-runtime=containerd
```

To start it with podman, on the server, you can start:

```
minikube config set rootless true
minikube start --driver=podman --container-runtime=containerd
```


```

```

The minikube profile command allows us to view the status of all our clusters in a table formatted output. Assuming we have created only the default minikube cluster, we could list the properties that define the default profile with:
```
$ minikube profile list
|----------|-----------|---------|--------------|------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| Profile  | VM Driver | Runtime |      IP      | Port | Version | Status  | Nodes | Active |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------------|------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
| minikube | docker    | docker  | 192.168.49.2 | 8443 | v1.26.1 | Running |     1 | *      |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------------|------|---------|---------|-------|--------|
```

This table presents the columns associated with the default properties such as the profile name: minikube, the isolation driver: docker, the container runtime: docker, the Kubernetes version: v1.26.1, the status of the cluster - running or stopped. The table also displays the number of nodes: 1 by default, the private IP address of the minikube cluster's control plane, and the secure port that exposes the API Server to cluster control plane components, agents and clients: 8443. If we had several different clusters, they would be listed here. 

To stop the minikube cluster, run: 

```
$ minikube stop 
✋  Stopping node "minikube"  ...
🛑  Apagando "minikube" mediante SSH...
🛑  1 node stopped.
```

### Accesing your cluster
Any healthy running Kubernetes cluster can be accessed via any one of the following methods:

- **Command Line Interface (CLI) tools and scripts with ```kubectl``` -- this is the preferred method for our tutorials**
- Web-based User Interface (Web UI) from a web browser with [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/)
- APIs from CLI or programmatically

These methods are applicable to all Kubernetes clusters.


### Run applications with Pods

You can run a Pod in two ways: 
- Creating a yaml file with the definition of the pod. This is a sample .yaml file named `nginx.yaml` to define an nginx service: 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata: 
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx:latest
    ports: 
    - containerPort: 80
```

After editing this file, you can run the Pod with: 
```
$ kubectl apply -f nginx.yaml 
pod/nginx created
```

Check the list of created pods with: 
```
$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
nginx                             1/1     Running   0             15s
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE     IP            NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx                             1/1     Running   0             20s     10.244.0.10   minikube   <none>           <none>
```
- Directly pulling the image from a repository and running it with ```run```. For example, this command will pull the latest nginx and run it as a service in a pod called ```myfirstpod```:  
  
```
$ kubectl run myfirstpod --image=nginx
pod/myfirstpod created
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE     IP            NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
myfirstpod                        1/1     Running   0             16s     10.244.0.11   minikube   <none>           <none>
nginx                             1/1     Running   0             3m50s   10.244.0.10   minikube   <none>           <none>
```

  
### Run Applications as Services 

To deploy an application that runs a service with Pods we need to create a **Deployment** and a **Service**. 

- A **Deployment** provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments. More information here: (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)

- A **Service** is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster. A key aim of Services in Kubernetes is that you don't need to modify your existing application to make it available on the network -- you can run code in Pods, whether this is a code designed for a cloud-native world, or an older app you've containerized, and you use a Service to make that set of Pods available on the network so that clients can interact with it.
If you use a Deployment to run your app, that Deployment can create and destroy Pods dynamically. From one moment to the next, you don't know how many of those Pods are working and healthy; you might not even know what those healthy Pods are named. Kubernetes Pods are created and destroyed to match the desired state of your cluster. Pods are emphemeral resources (you should not expect that an individual Pod is reliable and durable) and each Pod gets its own IP address (Kubernetes expects network plugins to ensure this). For a given Deployment in your cluster, the set of Pods running in one moment in time could be different from the set of Pods running that application a moment later. A Service is an abstraction to help you expose groups of Pods over a network. Each Service object defines a logical set of endpoints (usually these endpoints are Pods) along with a policy about how to make those pods accessible.
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)

#### Create a Deployment

To create a deployment, we need to first define a **Deployment** controller in a .yaml definition manifest file. This is the .yaml file (named webserver.yaml) for a deployment controller for a simple web services in nginx with 3 replicas: 
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webserver
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

```
We can run this deployment with: 

```
$ kubectl create -f webserver.yaml 
deployment.apps/webserver created
```
And check the pods created and number of replicas:
```
$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
webserver-774f96d4d9-k9k22        1/1     Running   0             23s
webserver-774f96d4d9-sblxp        1/1     Running   0             23s
webserver-774f96d4d9-vzgfd        1/1     Running   0             23s
$ kubectl get replicaset
NAME                        DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
webserver-774f96d4d9        3         3         3       81s

```

As an alternative to the .yaml definition file, we could also have created the webserver application by pulling the image directly with this command: 
```
$  kubectl create deployment webserver --image=nginx:alpine --replicas=3 --port=80
```

#### Create the Service
Once the deployment is created, we need to create the **Service**. Create a ```webserver-svc.yaml```file with the following content: 

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: nginx 

```

Here, the ```port``` is the port internally in the container. You can specify an external port using ```nodePort```, however, if you don't specify an additional port, kubernetes will just give you one from a pre-specified port range, which will be probably 30000-32767. 

Create the service with: 
```
$ kubectl create -f webserver-svc.yaml

service/web-service created
```
Now list the services created: 
```

$ kubectl get services

NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        1d
web-service   NodePort    10.110.47.84   <none>        80:31074/TCP   22s
```

Our web-service is now created and its ClusterIP is 10.110.47.84. In the PORT(S)section, we see a mapping of 80:31074, which means that we have reserved a static port 31074 on the node. If we connect to the node on that port, our requests will be proxied to the ClusterIP on port 80.

To get more details about the Service, we can use the ```kubectl describe``` command, as in the following example:
```

$ kubectl describe service web-service
Name:                     web-service
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   app=nginx
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 app=nginx
Type:                     NodePort
IP:                       10.110.47.84
Port:                     <unset>  80/TCP
TargetPort:               80/TCP
NodePort:                 <unset>  31074/TCP
Endpoints:                172.17.0.4:80,172.17.0.5:80,172.17.0.6:80
Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>
  
```
  
### Accessing an Application 
  
Our application is running on the Minikube node. To access the application from our workstation, let's first get the IP address of the Minikube machine:

```
$ minikube ip

192.168.99.100
```
Now, open the browser and access the application on 192.168.99.100 at port 31074 to check the ```Welcome to nginx!``` message. If you see the message you have successfully completed the configuration of an nginx web service with 3 replicas. If you are on a server, you can use ```lynx``` which is a command-line browser, or if that is not available, you can use wget, e.g., with ```wget http://192.168.99.100:31074``` to check.

If that doesn't work, we need to have an additional forwarding active:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/web-service 25164:80
```

Here, if you are working on the server, you should replace 25164 with one of the ports assigned to you. You will then be able to access the service at ```http://127.0.0.1:25164```.

To access it from outside, you need to do the following:

```
minikube tunnel --bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

```
kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 svc/web-service 25164:80
```


### What if one of your replicas fails?

After you have set up the webserver service, you will have 3 replicas of your nginx server running: 
```
$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
webserver-774f96d4d9-k9k22        1/1     Running   0              45m
webserver-774f96d4d9-sblxp        1/1     Running   0              46m
webserver-774f96d4d9-vzgfd        1/1     Running   0              46m
```
What if one of your replicas fails? Lets kill one of them with ```kubectl delete pod```
```
$ kubectl delete pod webserver-774f96d4d9-k9k22
pod "webserver-774f96d4d9-k9k22" deleted

```

What now? Check the status again and... you guess! 
```
$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
webserver-774f96d4d9-dl2bm        1/1     Running   0              3s
webserver-774f96d4d9-sblxp        1/1     Running   0              46m
webserver-774f96d4d9-vzgfd        1/1     Running   0              46m
```

If you remember the description of the Kubernetes Arquitecture, the Controller Manager in the Control Plane is continuously monitoring the Kubernetes cluster and realized that the cluster's desired state (3 replicas of the nginx server) was not the same as the current state (2 replicas), requesting a corrective action to be taken by the API Server. The API Server then forwarded the corresponding request to the Scheduler for a new worker node to match the desired state again.
